Our focus right now is on Stable Diffusion, but you'll be able to fine tune more models in the future like Whisper.

We provide you with all the resources you need to:

- Host your data
- Finetune your data on models
- Host your models w/ TuneMyAI or Huggingface

The process for finetuning a model is just a two step process:

1. Define and upload your dataset(s)
2. Create a training job with the dataset(s) to finetune on
