description: "Once you created the photo sets you want to finetune on, you can start a finetuning job."
openapi: "POST /job/finetune"

The finetune endpoint takes three parameters:

1. `imageSets`: The image sets you want to fine tune on as a list of the photo set slugs.
2. `webhookUrl`: The webhook URL to report events, including when your job has finished.
3. `trainingParams` (optional): The training parameters for the job.

While we provide sensible defaults for training so you can leave, the full set of training parameters are shown below.
